If you're building a reusable React component library (like your CIJ-Snipes), a good goal is to offer a well-rounded set of foundational components that can be used across many apps.

Here are core UI components and utility components you should consider adding:
‚úÖ Core UI Components

These are common, essential components used in most apps.

    With label and indeterminate state.

    For grouped radio button selections.

    Toggle / Switch
    For binary on/off settings.

    Modal / Dialog
    For overlays or confirmation windows.

    Tooltip
    Lightweight hint that shows on hover/focus.

    Popover
    Richer alternative to tooltip, often used for menus.

    ThemeProvider or config to allow light/dark mode and primary color overrides.

üì¶ Bonus (If you want to go further)

    DataGrid with editable rows, virtual scrolling

    FormWrapper / FormField abstraction to simplify validation with react-hook-form

    Rich Text Editor (using something like TipTap or Slate under the hood)
